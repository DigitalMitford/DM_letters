He was you must know a sun-worshipper--a salamander--never hot in his life, seldom warm--Well about 6 weeks ago he was met by a gentleman in this neighborhood half way up a hill in <placeName ref="#Italy">Italy</placeName>--his coat &amp; waistcoat on one side of him--his hat with his neck-cloth in it on the other--&amp; himself in the act of divesting himself of another article of his habiliments (in short his drawers) intending to accomplish the rest of the hill in his shirt &amp; trowsers. You don't know the man I believe--so can scarcely image to yourself what a perfection of gawkiness that uncravatted craggy neck would exhibit!--Really--I ought not to laugh at him--for he is very kind to me--don't give me for your authority if you should happen to tell the story.--<metamark rend="jerks"/>We have had today a very great &amp; unexpected pleasure--that of hearing from a friend whom we had entirely lost sight of during fifteen years.

Since then we have never heard of<pb n="4" facs="31July1822SirWilliamElford4b#.JPG"/> till today--She had lost our address in the Country--&amp; only found us out accidentally through the insertion of my Father's name in some justicing affair in the Windsor Paper where they are quartered. Only think what a pleasure it will be to see her--Mama and her Mother were old friends, so that we were so very intimate--But now we shall be all altered! She is I see just the same from her letter--just as kind &amp; warm hearted &amp; charming as ever--but to think of that lovely young woman with a parcel of great boys &amp; girls--that is astounding enough--but nothing to what she will feel in seeing the little shy quiet girl she remembers so kindly turned into a person of my rotundity--an old maid--&amp; an Authoress that is the worst part of the business--I am afraid she will be sadly shocked at that.--the lady of an Officer in the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Life Guards must of necessity &amp; of station have a great horror of a person who writes at so much per sheet!--Goodbye my very dear friend--On looking over this letter I see that it seems <emph rend="underline">fatigued</emph>--which I supposed because I that write it am tired with a long ride &amp; walk yesterday--ride &amp; walk yesterday--ride &amp; walk &amp; talk--for it was the last I believe that did me up--I went with a young friend to show her <placeName ref="#Silchester">Silchester</placeName> &amp; really when we came back we were both forced <pb n="5" facs="31July1822SirWilliamElford1a#.JPG"/><!--LMW:letter continues back on page one.
