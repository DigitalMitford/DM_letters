This is a repo for processing work on Digital Mitford letter TEI files. 
It also contains versioning work on Our Village sketches.
Previously, letters processing has been handled in the DM_processing repo, but starting May 2019 we're separating this work into its own repo to help make the processing more efficient and easier to share with the project team.
