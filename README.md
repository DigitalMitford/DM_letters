This is a repo for processing work on Digital Mitford letter TEI files. 
It also contains versioning work on Our Village sketches.
Previously, letters processing has been handled in the DM_processing repo, but starting May 2019 we're separating this work into its own repo to help make the processing more efficient and easier to share with the project team.

## Versioning transformations 
We're experimenting with transforming TEI critical apparatus markup together with other manuscript and prosopography markup into HTML with our customized project XSLT. Many thanks to @amberpeddicord for her help with these experimental transformations! 

Here is the HTML output a letter transformation:
* [1815-04-03: MRM to Sir William Elford](AppCrit-1815-04-03_Elford/1815-04-03_Elford_ac.html)

Here is the a versioned view of the 1823 *Lady's Magazine* publication of MRM's sketch, "A Parting Glance at Our Village," compared against the 1824 publication of that sketch in MRM's first edition of *Our Village*:
* [”A Parting Glance at Our Village”](AppCrit-OV/PartingGlance-versioned.html)
