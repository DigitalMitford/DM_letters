           <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching we are using the TEI elements <q>choice</q>, <q>sic</q>, and <q>reg</q> to encode both Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

But now he may scold as long as he pleases I have it under <pb n="2"/>your own hand that you like long letters &amp; long ones you shall have bad good &amp; indifferent--there is a Latin line which I am afraid of writing for fear of blunder <add place="above">but</add>which you doubtless remember which expresses pretty accurately the degree in which the aforesaid qualities are likely to appear in my epistles.--Now my dear <persName ref="#Elford_SirWm">Sir William</persName>, then I have like you &amp; <persName ref="#Cowper">Cowper</persName> done talking of my letter. I will if you please begin writing it. And first of all I must quarrel with you for depriving me of the pleasure of descanting on two such notable subjects as the Corn Laws &amp; <persName ref="#Napoleon">Bonaparte</persName> by being exactly of my opinion &amp; leaving me nothing to say. As to the Corn Laws they, I must confess, are but the Ghost of a subject &amp; even that troubled spirit seems likely enough to be laid in the <placeName ref="#Red_Sea">red Sea</placeName> by the mighty Conjuror of <placeName ref="#France">France</placeName>--but we might neverthless have had a very pretty little dispute about it if we had not happened to be of the same way of thinking--though I believe that I was less an advocate for them than you were (I take it for granted you see that you were for them though you defied me to find out on which side you had ranged yourself) from thinking in common with the best informed people in this neighbourhood that the difference either to the Farmer or the Consumer would be infinitely less than was expected not merely by the mob but by the rational part of their leaders. With regard to the <persName ref="#Napoleon">Emperor</persName> we are exactly of a mind--no country can have a right to dictate to another as to the form of its internal<pb n="3"/> Government, &amp; when a whole nation, consisting of course of those who act &amp; those who acquiesce, when a whole nation by one simultaneous &amp; bloodless revolution deposed one Monarch--a Monarch imposed on <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" quantity="1">them</del>
                    <add place="above">it</add> by conquering Kings &amp; replaces another of its own free &amp; unbiased choice, &amp; when <placeName ref="#France">France</placeName> is that Nation and <persName ref="#Napoleon">Napoleon</persName> that Monarch none but madmen would interfere &amp; none but fools could expect their interference to succeed. If <persName ref="#Napoleon">Napoleon</persName> be a Tyrant what is that to us! The French have deserved him <metamark rend="caret" place="below"/>

A local family—the Hintons of Chawton Lodge and their nephew Mr. Baverstock, a brewer in Alton—contested Edward Knight’s inheritance rights to Knight family property in Hampshire, which among other claims placed the Austen residences in Chawton at serious risk (Nokes 438-41; the lawsuit was finally settled in 1818 for £15,000)."  ]
