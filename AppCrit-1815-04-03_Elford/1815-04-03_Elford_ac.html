                           , 
                           Member of Parliament for Rye, 
                           Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), 
                           Fellow of the Linnaean Society (FLS) | Born: 1749-08 in Kingsbridge, Devon, England. Died: 1837-11-30 in Totnes, Devon, England. <br />
                           According to L’Estrange, Sir William was first a friend of
                           Mitford’s father, and 
                           Mitford met him for the first time in the
                           spring of 1810 when he was a widower nearing the
                           age of 64. They carried on a lively correspondence until his death
                           in 1837.
                           Elford worked as a banker at Plymouth Bank (Elford, Tingcombe and Purchase)
                           in Plymouth, Devon, from its
                           founding in 1782. He was elected a member of
                           Parliament for Plymouth as a
                           supporter of the government and Tory William
                           Pitt, and served from 1796 to 1806. After his election defeat
                           in Plymouth in 1806, he was elected member of Parliament for Rye and served
                           from July 1807 until his resignation in July 1808. For his service in
                           Parliament as a supporter of Pitt, he was made a baronet in 1800. After his
                           son Jonathan came of age, he tried to
                           secure a stable government post for him but never succeeded. Mayor of
                           Plymouth in 1796 and Recorder for Plymouth from 1797 to 1833, he was also
                           Recorder for Totnes from 1832 to 1834. Sir William served as an officer in
                           the South Devon militia from 1788, eventually attaining the rank of
                           Lieutenant Colonel; the unit saw active service in Ireland during the Peninsular Wars.
                           Sir
                           William was a talented amateur painter in oils and watercolors
                           who exhibited at the Royal Society from 1774 to 1837; he
                           exhibited still lifes and portraits but preferred landscapes. He was elected
                           to the Royal Society Academy in 1790. He was also a
                           talented amateur naturalist and was elected to the Royal Linnaean
                           Society in 1790; late in life, he published his findings on an
                           alternative to yeast.
                           He
                           married his first wife, Mary Davies
                           of Plympton, on January 20, 1776 and they had
                           one son, Jonathan, and two daughters,
                           Grace Chard and Elizabeth. After the death of his
                           first wife, he married Elizabeth Hall

                           Walrond of the Coldstream Guards.
                           His

                     George Mitford was born on November 15, 1760 in Hexham,
                     Northumberland, the son of Francis
                     Midford, surgeon, and Jane Graham. He was
                     related to the Mitfords of Mitford Castle, Northumberland. In 1784, he was living
                     in Alresford and is listed in a
                     Hampshire directory as "surgeon (medicine)." Although later sources would
                     claim that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh medical school,
                     there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree; his father and
                     grandfather worked as surgeon-apothecaries and it seems likely that he
                     served a medical apprenticeship with family members. He married Mary Russell on October
                     17, 1785 at New Alresford,
                     Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their
                     addresses as Old Alresford; they later came to live
                     at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live to adulthood,
                     Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years
                     later on December 16, 1787 at New
                     Alresford, Hampshire. George
                     Mitford died on December 11,
                     1842 at Three Mile

                           Mitford claims in a letter to Sir William Elford of 3 April 1815
                           that she has recently discovered Austen is my countrywoman,, that is, a neighbor.
                           Later in a letter of 2 July 1816 praised Emma in particular among Austen's novels.
                           She and Elford evidently knew the identity of Austen as the author long before the
                           information was public knowledge, and she claims in the April 3 letter that her mother
                           remembered Jane Austen in her youth as the prettiest, silliest, most affected, husband-hunting
                           butterfly she ever remembers, but that Jane was by the 1810s extremely quiet, which
                           impressed Mitford: till Pride and Prejudice showed what a precious gem was hidden
                           in that unbending case, she was no more regarded in society than a poker or a fire-screen,
                           or any other thin upright piece of wood or iron that fills its corner in peace and
                           quietness. The case is very different now; she is still a poker--but a poker of whom
                           every one is afraid. It must be confessed that this silent observation from such an
                           observer is rather formidable. Most writers are good-humoured chatterers--neither
                           very wise nor very witty:—but nine times out of ten (at least in the few that I have

                     older than her husband George, born in 1760.) Through the Russells, she was a
                     distant relation of the Dukes of Bedford (sixth creation, 1694). She had two
                     siblings, Charles William and Frances; both predeceased her and their parents,

                     Ashe was only a
                     short distance from Steventon, and so she was acquainted
                     with the young Jane Austen. She married
                     George Mitford or Midford on October 17, 1785 at New Alresford,
                     Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their

Died: 1830-01-02 in Three Mile Cross, parish of Shinfield, Berkshire,
                     England. <br />
                     Mary Russell was the youngest child of
                     the Rev. Dr. Richard Russell and
                     his second wife, Mary Dicker; she was born about 1750 in Ashe, Hampshire. (Her
                     birth date is as yet unverified; period sources indicate that she was ten years
                     older than her husband George, born in 1760.) Through the Russells, she was a
                     distant relation of the Dukes of Bedford (sixth creation, 1694). She had two
                     siblings, Charles William and Frances; both predeceased her and their parents,
                     which resulted in Mary Russell inheriting
                     her family’s entire estate upon her mother’s death in 1785. Her father’s rectory in
                     Ashe was only a
                     short distance from Steventon, and so she was acquainted
                     with the young Jane Austen. She married
                     George Mitford or Midford on October 17, 1785 at New Alresford,
                     Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their
                     addresses as Old Alresford. Their only daughter,
                     Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years
                     later on December 16, 1787 at New
                     Alresford, Hampshire. Mary
                     Russell died on January 2, 1830 at
                     Three Mile Cross in the parish of Shinfield,
                     Berkshire. Her obituary in the 1830 New

                           England. <br />
                           Mary Russell was the youngest child of
                           the Rev. Dr. Richard Russell and
                           his second wife, Mary Dicker; she was born about 1750 in Ashe, Hampshire. (Her
                           birth date is as yet unverified; period sources indicate that she was ten years
                           older than her husband George, born in 1760.) Through the Russells, she was a
                           distant relation of the Dukes of Bedford (sixth creation, 1694). She had two
                           siblings, Charles William and Frances; both predeceased her and their parents,
                           which resulted in Mary Russell inheriting
                           her family’s entire estate upon her mother’s death in 1785. Her father’s rectory in
                           Ashe was only a
                           short distance from Steventon, and so she was acquainted
                           with the young Jane Austen. She married
                           George Mitford or Midford on October 17, 1785 at New Alresford,
                           Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their
                           addresses as Old Alresford. Their only daughter,
                           Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years
                           later on December 16, 1787 at New
                           Alresford, Hampshire. Mary
                           Russell died on January 2, 1830 at
                           Three Mile Cross in the parish of Shinfield,

                           served a medical apprenticeship with family members. He married Mary Russell on October
                           17, 1785 at New Alresford,

                           the subject of our archive. Mary Russell
                           Mitford was born on December 16,
                           1787 at New Alresford, Hampshire, the only

                           and Mary Russell. She was baptized on
                           February 29, 1788. Much of her writing was
                           devoted to supporting herself and her
                           parents. She received a civil list pension in 1837. Census records from 1841 indicate
                           that she is living with her
                           father George, three female servants:
                           Kerenhappuch Taylor (Mary’s ladies
                           maid), two maids of all work, Mary Bramley and Mary Allaway, and a manservant
                           (probably serving also as gardener), Benjamin Embury. The 1851 census lists her
                           occupation as "authoress," and lists her as living at Three Mile Cross with Kerenhappuch
                           Taylor (lady’s maid), Sarah Chernk
                           (maid-of-all-work), and Samuel Swetman (gardener), after the death of her

M.<span class="si">Mary Russell Mitford | Born: 1787-12-16 in New Alresford, Hampshire, England. Died: 1855-01-10 in Swallowfield, Berkshire, England. <br />Poet, playwright, writer of prose fiction
                           sketches, Mary Russell Mitford is, of course,
                           the subject of our archive. Mary Russell
                           Mitford was born on December 16,
                           1787 at New Alresford, Hampshire, the only
                           child of George Mitford (or Midford)
                           and Mary Russell. She was baptized on
                           February 29, 1788. Much of her writing was
                           devoted to supporting herself and her
                           parents. She received a civil list pension in 1837. Census records from 1841 indicate
                           that she is living with her
                           father George, three female servants:
                           Kerenhappuch Taylor (Mary’s ladies
                           maid), two maids of all work, Mary Bramley and Mary Allaway, and a manservant
                           (probably serving also as gardener), Benjamin Embury. The 1851 census lists her
                           occupation as "authoress," and lists her as living at Three Mile Cross with Kerenhappuch
                           Taylor (lady’s maid), Sarah Chernk
                           (maid-of-all-work), and Samuel Swetman (gardener), after the death of her
                           father. Mitford’s long life and prolific career ended after injuries from a

                     of the Thames and the River Kennet. The town developed as a river port and in
                     Mitford’s time served as a staging point on
                     the Bath Road and was developing into a center of manufacturing. Mitford lived here
                     with her parents from 1791 to 1795, on Coley Avenue in the parish of St.
                     Mary’s and attended the Abbey School. The family returned to Reading from 1797 to
                     about 1804, after which they
                     relocated to Bertram House. They
                     frequently visited Reading thereafter from their homes at nearby Bertram House, Three
                     Mile Cross and Swallowfield. Mitford later used scenes from Reading as the basis for

                     According to L’Estrange, Sir William was first a friend of
                     Mitford’s father, and 
                     Mitford met him for the first time in the
                     spring of 1810 when he was a widower nearing the
                     age of 64. They carried on a lively correspondence until his death
                     in 1837.
                     Elford worked as a banker at Plymouth Bank (Elford, Tingcombe and Purchase)
                     in Plymouth, Devon, from its
                     founding in 1782. He was elected a member of
                     Parliament for Plymouth as a
                     supporter of the government and Tory William
                     Pitt, and served from 1796 to 1806. After his election defeat
                     in Plymouth in 1806, he was elected member of Parliament for Rye and served
                     from July 1807 until his resignation in July 1808. For his service in
                     Parliament as a supporter of Pitt, he was made a baronet in 1800. After his
                     son Jonathan came of age, he tried to
                     secure a stable government post for him but never succeeded. Mayor of
                     Plymouth in 1796 and Recorder for Plymouth from 1797 to 1833, he was also
                     Recorder for Totnes from 1832 to 1834. Sir William served as an officer in
                     the South Devon militia from 1788, eventually attaining the rank of
                     Lieutenant Colonel; the unit saw active service in Ireland during the Peninsular Wars.
                     Sir
                     William was a talented amateur painter in oils and watercolors
                     who exhibited at the Royal Society from 1774 to 1837; he
                     exhibited still lifes and portraits but preferred landscapes. He was elected
                     to the Royal Society Academy in 1790. He was also a
                     talented amateur naturalist and was elected to the Royal Linnaean
                     Society in 1790; late in life, he published his findings on an
                     alternative to yeast.
                     He
                     married his first wife, Mary Davies
                     of Plympton, on January 20, 1776 and they had
                     one son, Jonathan, and two daughters,
                     Grace Chard and Elizabeth. After the death of his
                     first wife, he married Elizabeth Hall
                     Walrond, widow of Lieutenant-Colonel Maine Swete
                     Walrond of the Coldstream Guards.
                     His
                     only son Jonathan died in 1823, leaving him without an heir.
