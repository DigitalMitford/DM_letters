Died: 1842-12-11 in Three Mile Cross, Shinfield, Berkshire, England. <br />
                           
                           George Mitford was born on November 15, 1760 in Hexham,
                           Northumberland, the son of Francis
                           Midford, surgeon, and Jane Graham. He was
                           related to the Mitfords of Mitford Castle, Northumberland. In 1784, he was living
                           in Alresford and is listed in a
                           Hampshire directory as "surgeon (medicine)." Although later sources would
                           claim that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh medical school,
                           there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree; his father and
                           grandfather worked as surgeon-apothecaries and it seems likely that he
                           served a medical apprenticeship with family members. He married Mary Russell on October
                           17, 1785 at New Alresford,
                           Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their
                           addresses as Old Alresford; they later came to live
                           at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live to adulthood,
                           Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years
                           later on December 16, 1787 at New
                           Alresford, Hampshire. George
                           Mitford died on December 11,
                           1842 at Three Mile
                           Cross in the parish of Shinfield,
                           Berkshire.

                           Mary Russell was the youngest child of
                           the Rev. Dr. Richard Russell and
                           his second wife, Mary Dicker; she was born about 1750 in Ashe, Hampshire. (Her
                           birth date is as yet unverified; period sources indicate that she was ten years
                           older than her husband George, born in 1760.) Through the Russells, she was a
                           distant relation of the Dukes of Bedford (sixth creation, 1694). She had two
                           siblings, Charles William and Frances; both predeceased her and their parents,
                           which resulted in Mary Russell inheriting
                           her family’s entire estate upon her mother’s death in 1785. Her father’s rectory in
                           Ashe was only a
                           short distance from Steventon, and so she was acquainted
                           with the young Jane Austen. She married
                           George Mitford or Midford on October 17, 1785 at New Alresford,
                           Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their
                           addresses as Old Alresford. Their only daughter,
                           Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years
                           later on December 16, 1787 at New
                           Alresford, Hampshire. Mary
                           Russell died on January 2, 1830 at
                           Three Mile Cross in the parish of Shinfield,
                           Berkshire. Her obituary in the 1830 New

                           Mary Russell was the youngest child of

                           birth date is as yet unverified; period sources indicate that she was ten years

                           distant relation of the Dukes of Bedford (sixth creation, 1694). She had two

                           Ashe was only a
                           short distance from Steventon, and so she was acquainted
                           with the young Jane Austen. She married
                           George Mitford or Midford on October 17, 1785 at New Alresford,
                           Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their

                        Mitford’s time served as a staging point on
                        the Bath Road and was developing into a center of manufacturing. Mitford lived here
                        with her parents from 1791 to 1795, on Coley Avenue in the parish of St.
                        Mary’s and attended the Abbey School. The family returned to Reading from 1797 to

                        relocated to Bertram House. They

                        According to L’Estrange, Sir William was first a friend of
                        Mitford’s father, and 
                        Mitford met him for the first time in the
                        spring of 1810 when he was a widower nearing the
                        age of 64. They carried on a lively correspondence until his death
                        in 1837.
                        Elford worked as a banker at Plymouth Bank (Elford, Tingcombe and Purchase)
                        in Plymouth, Devon, from its
                        founding in 1782. He was elected a member of
                        Parliament for Plymouth as a
                        supporter of the government and Tory William
                        Pitt, and served from 1796 to 1806. After his election defeat
                        in Plymouth in 1806, he was elected member of Parliament for Rye and served
                        from July 1807 until his resignation in July 1808. For his service in
                        Parliament as a supporter of Pitt, he was made a baronet in 1800. After his
                        son Jonathan came of age, he tried to
                        secure a stable government post for him but never succeeded. Mayor of
                        Plymouth in 1796 and Recorder for Plymouth from 1797 to 1833, he was also
                        Recorder for Totnes from 1832 to 1834. Sir William served as an officer in
                        the South Devon militia from 1788, eventually attaining the rank of
                        Lieutenant Colonel; the unit saw active service in Ireland during the Peninsular Wars.
                        Sir
                        William was a talented amateur painter in oils and watercolors
                        who exhibited at the Royal Society from 1774 to 1837; he
                        exhibited still lifes and portraits but preferred landscapes. He was elected
                        to the Royal Society Academy in 1790. He was also a
                        talented amateur naturalist and was elected to the Royal Linnaean
                        Society in 1790; late in life, he published his findings on an
                        alternative to yeast.
                        He
                        married his first wife, Mary Davies
                        of Plympton, on January 20, 1776 and they had
                        one son, Jonathan, and two daughters,
                        Grace Chard and Elizabeth. After the death of his
                        first wife, he married Elizabeth Hall

                        Walrond of the Coldstream Guards.
                        His
                        only son Jonathan died in 1823, leaving him without an heir.
